# script.cortanaWebServer
Simple but flexible HTTP/HTTPS hosting utility for XBMC4Xbox. 

## Working:
- HTTP support
- HTTPS support
- Basic username/password authentication
- Directory logging + downloading/streaming
- Connection logging
- Custom 403/404 redirect pages

## Not Planned:
- MySQL / PHP support (not possible)
- Upload Support(?) (would involve using a fork like BaseHTTPServerWithUpload)
